# Comparison of interpolation algorithms

## Cubic method
A method of performing smoother interpolation by increasing the expressive power of the auxiliary line by connecting the two points with a cubic equation and by limiting the differential information of the interpolation line at each interpolation point.

## Pattern 1 : Basic implementation in Python

## Pattern 2 : Cubic method using Scipy's API
